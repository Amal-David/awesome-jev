# Awesome Jev [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

[Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai) is TypeSafe's System One model for probability-based yes/no judgments, choices, and scores rather than generated text.

Check permissions and data handling before running a project. Source review is not a runtime test or a security audit.

## Getting Started

Start with the [quick-start example](docs/DIRECTORY.md#20-second-quick-start), then build a [typed classifier](docs/START_HERE.md#build-your-first-typed-classifier), use Jev in an [agent](docs/START_HERE.md#use-jev-in-an-agent), or explore a [local alternative](docs/START_HERE.md#explore-a-local-alternative). The [source notes](docs/REVIEWED.md) record setup, privacy, and evidence limits for the selections below.

## Demos

A few examples to watch before digging into the code. These are creator recordings and publisher previews, not independent benchmarks. Linked previews open the original recording or post.

Suggest a project with a concrete Jev role, implementation evidence, and honest limitations. Read the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [selection policy](docs/CURATION.md) first.

## Footnotes

The larger [discovery catalog](docs/CATALOG.md), [local viewer](docs/BROWSE.md), and [refresh history](docs/STATUS.md) are separate from this editorial file. The [gallery selection notes](docs/README_GALLERY.md) explain the dated traction checks and editorial ordering; this is not a live popularity leaderboard. Discovery, research, and drafting have used AI assistance; this project does not claim an exclusively human-authored history or admission to the canonical Awesome index.
